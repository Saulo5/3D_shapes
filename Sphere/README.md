<h3 align="left">Code to create a point cloud of a sphere as an object, given the following parameters as input:</h3>

- center point for the sphere: [x, y, z]
- Radious of the sphere: R
- Rotation axis direction: [rx, ry, rz]
- division of the meshgrid in deg, for 1 degree it creates a circel with 360 points, for 30 degree it creates a
- circle represented by 12 points and so on.

<h3 align="left">Outputs:</h3>
- 3D points representing the Sphere: array[m x 3]
- normal vectors corresponding to each point array[m x 3]
